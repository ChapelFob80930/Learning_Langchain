Seeing how more streaming platforms are embracing anime due to demand, we all get to enjoy some of the most beloved and newest anime shows on our favorite platforms.\\n\\n  Madhouse\\nI have loved anime for as long as I can remember. My first introduction was when I saw\\xa0Ninja Scroll and Akira as a kid on VHS at a friend\\'s house. I remember thinking, \"There\\'s no way I should be watching this, but man it\\'s awesome!\"\\xa0\\n  Toho / Via youtube.com\\n\\nAnime, like any form of entertainment, has matured greatly in animation, storytelling, and character development. Over the years, many anime shows have come and gone, some good, some bad, some unforgettable. This is a list of MY favorite anime shows of all time.\\n\\n30.\\nSolo Leveling\\n\\n  ©Solo Leveling Animation Partners\\nI\\'ll start this list with one of the newest anime shows to hit 2024. Now you might be thinking that this show is too new to be labeled one of the greatest, but I\\'m placing my bet early. I believe that by the time this show is all wrapped up, we will be saying it\\'s up there. If you\\'re not familiar,\\xa0Solo Leveling\\xa0is a South Korean webtoon that was adapted by Japanese Animated studio A-1 Pictures. The show follows Sung Jin-woo, an E-rank hunter, in a world where gates to dungeons have opened, unleashing monsters upon humanity. After a near-death experience in a dungeon, Jin-woo discovers he has the ability to level up and grow stronger. As he embarks on his journey as a \"Solo Player,\" he aims to become the most powerful hunter and protect humanity from the looming threats of the dungeons. The story is filled with intense battles, mystery, and Jin-woo\\'s quest for strength and identity. A second season has already been announced, and with all the hype this show has gotten already, due to the animation and story, I can\\'t wait to see what comes next.\\xa0\\n29.\\nHell\\'s Paradise\\n\\n  ©YUJI KAKU/SHUEISHA, TWIN ENGINE, MAPPA\\nMAPPA has done it again with yet another great anime, Hell\\'s Paradise. Hell\\'s Paradise centers on Gabimaru, a skilled ninja sentenced to death but given a chance at redemption by embarking on a dangerous mission. In a world where immortality is possible, Gabimaru, alongside other criminals, is tasked with finding the elixir of life on a mysterious island filled with lethal traps, monstrous creatures, and deadly adversaries. As the group navigates the perils of the island, they face their inner demons and form unlikely alliances while striving to survive and accomplish their mission. With intense action, complex characters, and exploration of themes such as redemption and the meaning of life, this new shonen has quickly risen through the ranks as an all-time favorite.\\xa0\\n28.\\nMashle: Magic and Muscles\\n\\n  ©Hajime Komoto/SHUEISHA, MASHLE Committee\\nWith one of the catchiest opening intros ever,\\xa0Mashle: Magic and Muscles is perfect for any Harry Potter fans who also love anime. In a society where magic is everything, Mash\\'s lack of magical ability makes him an outcast and at risk of execution. The only way for Mash to save himself, and his adoptive father, is for him to enroll in Easton Magic Academy; a prestigious school for magic users. To survive in this world of magic, Mash relies solely on his extraordinary physical strength and combat skills. As he navigates the challenges of the academy, Mash\\'s unconventional methods and unwavering determination begin to earn him both friends and enemies. The series blends elements of comedy, action, and adventure as Mash strives to prove that strength comes in many forms, not just through magic, but the love of cream puffs.\\xa0\\n27.\\nFire Force\\n\\n  ©Atsushi Ohkubo, KODANSHA/ “FIRE FORCE” Production Committee\\nFire Force is set in a world where spontaneous human combustion turns people into living infernos called \"Infernals.\" To combat this threat, special firefighters known as the \"Fire Force\" are tasked with extinguishing Infernals and investigating the cause behind the phenomenon. The story follows Shinra Kusakabe, a young man with the unique ability to ignite his feet at will, granting him powerful propulsion abilities. Shinra joins Special Fire Force Company 8, a group of eccentric firefighters with their own special abilities, led by the enigmatic Captain Akitaru Obi. As Shinra and his comrades battle Infernals and uncover dark secrets surrounding the phenomenon, they also face off against other Fire Force companies, religious organizations, and mysterious figures with their own agendas. Alongside intense firefighting action, the series delves into themes of redemption, teamwork, and the nature of heroism in the face of adversity.\\xa0\\xa0\\n26.\\nSpy x Family\\n\\n  © Tatsuya Endo/Shueisha, SPY x FAMILY Project\\nThis comedic and action-packed anime follows the story of Twilight, a master spy tasked with a mission to steal information from a high-ranking government official by infiltrating the prestigious school his target\\'s son attends. To accomplish his mission, he needs to create the perfect cover: a family. Twilight adopts a young girl named Anya, who has telepathic abilities, and decides to pose as a doting father. However, he soon discovers that Anya is an orphan with no known background. In order to maintain his cover, Twilight decides to marry a woman named Yor Forger, who happens to be a highly skilled assassin. Unbeknownst to Twilight, Yor is also on her own mission and agrees to the marriage to further her goals. As the unlikely family tries to blend in and navigate their new roles, they find themselves caught up in hilarious situations, dangerous missions, and heartwarming moments as they form genuine bonds with each other while balancing their individual secrets and missions. There\\'s a reason this show has become such a hit, so if you haven\\'t seen it, please do.\\xa0\\n25.\\nBerserk\\n\\n  OLM Team Iguchi / Via youtube.com\\nAn epic dark fantasy that delves into the gritty and complex journey of its protagonist, Guts. Set in a medieval-inspired world filled with political intrigue, supernatural elements, and intense battles, the series follows Guts, a skilled and hardened mercenary with a troubled past. His path intertwines with that of Griffith, the enigmatic leader of the Band of the Hawk, and their fateful encounter sets off a chain of events that will shape the destiny of nations.

The compelling blend of action, drama, and philosophical exploration, paired with morally complex characters and thought-provoking narratives helped captivate audiences from the late \\'90s to now.\\n24.\\nAkame ga Kill!\\n\\n  White Fox / Via youtube.com\\nIf you were a fan of Game of Thrones\\xa0and the way George R.R. Martin emotionally scarred you with character deaths, then you\\'ll love Akame ga Kill! The show\\xa0follows Tatsumi, a young and naive warrior who leaves his impoverished village with dreams of earning money to help his home. However, upon arriving in the capital, he quickly discovers the extent of the city\\'s corruption and cruelty. After a series of tragic events, Tatsumi is recruited by Night Raid, a covert group of assassins working for the Revolutionary Army. Their mission is to overthrow the corrupt Prime Minister Honest, who controls the young and impressionable Emperor and, by extension, the entire empire. Akame ga Kill!\\xa0is a standout anime series due to its compelling storyline, complex characters, intense action, and emotional depth. Its willingness to explore dark themes and present a realistic portrayal of the consequences of war and rebellion make it a memorable and impactful series.\\xa0\\n23.\\nSummer Time Rendering\\n\\n  OLM Team Kojima / Via youtube.com\\nAdapted from Yasuki Tanaka\\'s manga, Summer Time Rendering\\xa0revolves around Shinpei Ajiro, who returns to his hometown on the remote island of Hitogashima for the funeral of his childhood friend Ushio Kofune, who died under mysterious circumstances. As Shinpei delves deeper into the events surrounding Ushio\\'s death, he discovers a series of strange occurrences and unravels a supernatural mystery involving shadowy doppelgängers and time loops. The blend of mystery, horror, and supernatural elements, combined with the intricate plot, and high production quality make it a must-watch anime that leaves a lasting impression after the credits roll.\\xa0\\xa0\\n22.\\nCyberpunk: Edgerunners\\n\\n  Studio Trigger / Via youtube.com\\nCyberpunk 2077\\xa0was notoriously dragged through the mud for several issues that plagued the game at the time of launch, but there was one thing that was never in question, the story. Set in the dystopian future of Night City, adapted from the popular video game Cyberpunk 2077 by CD Projekt Red, the story centers on David Martinez, a street-smart teenager struggling to survive in a society heavily influenced by advanced technology and corporate greed. David\\'s journey from a struggling student to a powerful yet conflicted mercenary is compelling and well-developed. But his character isn\\'t the only shining light in this incredible series as his supporting characters are equally captivating, setting up a feeling of loss when one tragically meets their end. There\\'s a reason this show won several anime awards including Crunchyroll\\'s annual award for \"Best Anime\" which is game recognizing game as Cyberpunk: Edgerunners is exclusively on Netflix. Go on and dive into this incredible series if you haven\\'t already, choom.\\xa0\\n21.\\nChainsaw Man\\n\\n  ©Tatsuki Fujimoto/SHUEISHA, MAPPA\\nOne of 2022\\'s standout shows, Chainsaw Man\\xa0gave us riveting horror, action, and dark humor with a unique and unpredictable narrative. Denji is a young man burdened with a massive debt left by his deceased father. To repay it, he works as a devil hunter for the yakuza, using his pet devil, Pochita, who can transform into chainsaw weapons. After being betrayed and killed by the yakuza, Denji merges with Pochita, coming back to life as the titular Chainsaw Man, a powerful hybrid with chainsaws sprouting from his arms and head. After being recruited by the Public Safety Devil Hunters, an organization dedicated to protecting humanity from dangerous devils, we see Denji navigate his new life, fight various devils, and form rather complex relationships with other devil hunters such as Power and Aki. There\\'s no question this show is going to captivate more and more viewers as the seasons drop; the varying degrees of comedy and drama this show offers are as good as it gets.\\xa0\\n20.\\nDeath Note\\n\\n  ©DNDP, VAP, Shueisha, Madhouse\\nDeath Note stands out as one of the greatest anime of all time due to its innovative premise, deep psychological and moral questions, complex characters, and high production quality. The story revolves around Light Yagami, a brilliant high school student who stumbles upon a mysterious notebook called the Death Note. This notebook grants its user the ability to kill anyone whose name and face they know, simply by writing the person\\'s name in the notebook. Its blend of suspense, intellect, and dark themes creates a lasting impression, making it a benchmark for storytelling in anime. The series not only entertains but also challenges viewers to think critically about justice, power, and the human condition, solidifying its place in the pantheon of anime greatness. Before Dexter,\\xa0there was Light, a vigilante whose arc stands as one of the best in anime.\\xa0\\n19.\\nRurouni Kenshin\\n\\n  © 1997 N. Watsuki / Shueisha, Fuji-TV, Aniplex Inc.\\nRurouni Kenshin, also known as \"Samurai X,\" unfolds during the early Meiji era in Japan. It chronicles the life of Kenshin Himura, a former assassin once feared as \"Battousai the Manslayer.\" Following his involvement in the Bakumatsu war, Kenshin commits to making amends for his sins by safeguarding the innocent and eschewing killing, wielding a reverse-edged sword (sakabato) to embody his newfound pacifist principles. The show\\'s excellence lies not only in its thrilling action but also in its exploration of Kenshin\\'s nonviolence against the contrasting beliefs of other characters, offering a layered conversation about the use of violence and its consequences. This theme, coupled with a protagonist striving to correct his past misdeeds while confronting the errors of his former life, cements the series as a timeless masterpiece.\\n18.\\nDragon Ball Z\\n\\n  ©BIRD STUDIO/SHUEISHA, TOEI ANIMATION\\nThe passing of Akira Toriyama, the creator of Dragon Ball, underscores the show\\'s profound impact on multiple generations. The outpouring of love and support reflects the number of people who not only grew up with this remarkable series but also encountered anime for the first time through Dragon Ball Z. This iconic series, which follows Goku\\'s adventures as an adult after the events of Dragon Ball, has captivated audiences with its epic battles, rigorous training sequences, and a host of unforgettable characters. Whether it\\'s the classic Dragon Ball Z or the newest Dragon Ball Super,\\xa0its inspirational themes have created a lasting legacy, shaping the imaginations of fans and creators for years to come.\\n17.\\nHajime no Ippo\\n\\n  Madhouse\\nNumerous anime series effectively portray sports realistically, yet in my view, none excel quite like\\xa0Hajime no Ippo. The protagonist, Ippo Makunouchi, is an underdog — a timid, bullied high schooler who uncovers a talent for boxing. The show follows Ippo\\'s journey from an inexperienced beginner to a skilled fighter, accentuating his personal and athletic evolution. Ippo\\'s modesty, perseverance, and benevolence make him a character to cheer for. His progression is portrayed realistically and with emotional depth, akin to DBZ, rendering the series both captivating and motivational. The combination of heart, excitement, and humor solidifies its status as one of the premier sports anime ever created.\\n16.\\nHunter x Hunter\\n\\n  ©P98-24 © V ∙ N ∙ M\\nGon Freecss, a young boy who discovers that his long-lost father, Ging, is a legendary Hunter — an elite member of humanity, capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals. Determined to find his father, Gon embarks on a journey to become a Hunter himself, making friends and facing various challenges along the way. I think what\\'s made Hunter x Hunter\\xa0such a longtime classic is that each arc in Hunter x Hunter\\xa0offers a unique and compelling narrative, ranging from adventure and mystery to dark psychological drama and intense action. Seeing Gon and Killua go through adventures together all the while becoming some of the strongest hunters out there, is reminiscent of Naruto and Sasuke or Goku and Vegeta but way more friendlier.\\xa0\\n15.\\nTokyo Revengers\\n\\n  Liden Films / Via youtube.com\\nThe story centers on Takemichi Hanagaki, a disenchanted adult who finds he can time-travel back to his middle school days. He aims to change the dire fate of his childhood sweetheart, Hinata Tachibana, who fell victim to the Tokyo Manji Gang. Takemichi decides to infiltrate the gang to rewrite history. While navigating the perilous realm of delinquents and gangs, he confronts his own doubts and past regrets, all the while fighting to safeguard those dear to him. The creator, Ken Wakui, draws from his experience in the \"Black Emperor Gang,\" lending authenticity to this time-traveling saga filled with relentless plot twists that captivate viewers. From touching moments to intense battles, this is a show worth watching if you haven\\'t already.\\n14.\\nOne Piece\\n\\n  ©Eiichiro Oda/Shueisha, Toei Animation\\nOne Piece follows the journey of Monkey D. Luffy, a young pirate with the ability to stretch his body like rubber after eating the long-treasured Devil Fruit. Luffy dreams of finding the legendary treasure known as \"One Piece\" and becoming the Pirate King. Along the way, he assembles a diverse crew known as the Straw Hat Pirates, each with unique abilities and dreams of their own. Together, they navigate the treacherous Grand Line, facing formidable foes and uncovering deep-seated mysteries of their world. Now being one of the longest-running anime ever is definitely an achievement. Though for some, starting One Piece\\xa0from Episode 1 seems like a daunting task, seeing how the show has already passed a whopping thousand episodes. The world of One Piece is incredibly vast and intricately designed, with diverse islands, cultures, species, and political structures. Each new location brings fresh adventures and deeper lore. The series masterfully intertwines its vast history, legendary figures, and intricate geopolitical elements, creating a deeply immersive universe. So if you\\'re willing to put in the time and energy to try and catch up on One Piece,\\xa0just think of it as you partaking in your own voyage across the Grand Line while you sit through countless episodes.\\xa0\\n13.\\nTrigun\\n\\n  ©Yasuhiro Nightow/Shonengahosha, FlyingDog. Licensed by FlyingDog, Inc.\\nSet in a post-apocalyptic world reminiscent of the Wild West, the story follows Vash the Stampede, a legendary gunslinger with a mysterious past and a $$60 billion (double dollar) bounty on his head. Despite his reputation as a ruthless outlaw, Vash is actually a pacifist with a strong moral code, seeking to avoid violence and protect innocent lives. As he journeys across the desolate planet, Vash is pursued by bounty hunters and law enforcement, while also confronting his own tragic past and the dangerous foes that emerge from it. Vash is a deeply layered character. His goofy, carefree exterior masks a profound inner turmoil and commitment to nonviolence. His struggle to uphold his ideals in a violent world adds significant depth to his character. For me, Trigun\\xa0is considered one of the greatest anime of all time due to its complex protagonist, strong supporting cast, thematic depth, unique setting, and engaging plot.\\n12.\\nBlue Eye Samurai\\n\\n  Netflix Animation / Via youtube.com\\nBlending historical elements with rich storytelling and dynamic action sequences,\\xa0Blue Eye Samurai is perfect for anybody who recently loved FX\\'s Shogun. The story revolves around a blue-eyed samurai named Akemi, who stands out in a society where blue eyes are rare and often met with suspicion or disdain. Akemi embarks on a quest for vengeance against those who wronged her family, wielding her sword with unmatched skill and a deep-seated determination. Throughout her journey, Akemi encounters various allies and enemies, each shaping her path and challenging her understanding of honor, justice, and her own identity. Blue Eye Samurai\\xa0stands out as a potential classic due to its rich and engaging storyline, deep character development, historical and cultural richness, stunning animation, and exploration of profound themes. By addressing Akemi\\'s adventure for vengeance through the lens of a unique historical setting, Blue Eyed Samurai earns its place among the greatest anime of all time.\\n11.\\nYu Yu Hakusho\\n\\n  © Yoshihiro Togashi 1990-1994 \"Yu Yu Hakusho\"/comics originally serialized in the WEEKLY SHONEN JUMP published by Shueisha Inc. TV animation series \"Yu Yu Hakusho\" is produced by © Pierrot/Shueisha\\nYu Yu Hakusho\\xa0chronicles the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a teenage delinquent who is killed in a car accident while attempting to save a child. Posthumously, Yusuke is granted a second chance at life, taking on the role of a \"Spirit Detective\" to probe into paranormal activities in the human and demon realms. Joined by his comrades Kuwabara, Hiei, and Kurama, Yusuke undertakes various quests, combats formidable adversaries, and faces existential dangers threatening both realms. Yusuke Urameshi evolves from a defiant troublemaker to a gallant savior, forming the emotional backbone of the story. The series features an eclectic ensemble of characters, each with distinct traits, histories, and drives. From Kuwabara\\'s fiery temper to Hiei\\'s mystery and Kurama\\'s shrewdness, they all enrich the story\\'s tapestry. As an exhilarating martial arts saga and a thought-provoking exploration of humanity, Yu Yu Hakusho continues to captivate audiences worldwide.\\n10.\\nThe Rising of the Shield Hero\\n\\n  ©2019 Aneko Yusagi/KADOKAWA/Shield Hero production committee\\nAdapted from Aneko Yusagi\\'s light novel series, the story follows Naofumi Iwatani, a college student summoned to a fantasy world to become one of four legendary heroes, each armed with their own mythical weapon: sword, spear, bow, and shield. Naofumi, designated as the \"Shield Hero,\" is deemed the weakest and faces societal ostracism due to unfounded accusations. Striving to clear his name and survive, Naofumi forms an uneasy alliance with Raphtalia, a demi-human slave, and Filo, a girl with the power to transform into a formidable bird-like creature, her Filolial form. Together, they set out to fortify themselves, defend against devastating monster onslaughts, and unravel the plot that falsely incriminated Naofumi. His role as the \"Shield Hero\" challenges conventional fantasy narratives and enriches the plot. His battle against discrimination and treachery has captured audiences, laying the groundwork for an enthralling tale. The series is renowned for its dynamic and well-crafted action scenes, especially during the monstrous waves that besiege the world. Naofumi\\'s tactical shield maneuvers and his allies\\' distinct powers lend some complexity and thrill to the combat. The\\xa0Rising of the Shield Hero\\xa0grabs your attention with poignant emotional beats, ranging from uplifting displays of unity and companionship, to intense episodes of conflict and deception, all the things you want in a great anime.\\n9.\\nSamurai Champloo\\n\\n  Manglobe / Via youtube.com\\nShinichirō Watanabe, celebrated for his work on Cowboy Bebop, succeeded it with Samurai Champloo, a series many consider equal or superior to its predecessor. Set in an alternate Edo-period Japan, it follows three disparate companions: Mugen, an untamed swordsman; Jin, a composed and disciplined rōnin; and Fuu, a vivacious young woman searching for the \"samurai who smells of sunflowers.\" United by destiny, they traverse Japan, encountering colorful characters, clashing in legendary sword battles, and experiencing the era\\'s rich culture. Samurai Champloo fuses historical fiction, action-adventure, comedy, and hip-hop, forging a unique and striking style.

Determined to avenge his family and find a cure for Nezuko, Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer Corps, an organization dedicated to eradicating demons. Tanjiro, along with his companions Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira, faces numerous challenges and powerful demons as they strive to protect humanity. Along the way, they encounter allies such as the Hashira, the Corps\\' elite warriors, and face the series\\' primary antagonist, Muzan Kibutsuji, the first and most powerful demon.

Tanjiro is a well-rounded and relatable protagonist whose compassion and determination drive the narrative. His unwavering love for his sister Nezuko and his resolve to protect others make him a character audiences root for. The series often portrays its antagonists, the demons, with a surprising amount of empathy, revealing their tragic pasts and humanizing them. This adds complexity to the narrative, showing that the line between good and evil is often blurred. Seeing that Demon Slayer has literally been breaking box office records with its film and garnering over 15 million viewers with Season 3, it\\'s no surprise that it\\'s become one of the greatest anime for a lot of people as of late.\\xa0\\n2.\\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\\n\\n  Bones / Via youtube.com\\nThe story revolves around brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric, who use the powerful science of alchemy to cope with their loss.

The siblings set out on a quest to retrieve the Philosopher\\'s Stone, an alchemical relic said to override the basic principles of alchemy. Their journey exposes them to entrenched government conspiracies, formidable enemies, and the stark reality of the Philosopher\\'s Stone and the price of human transmutation. The narrative explores deep themes like the morality of scientific inquiry, the ramifications of power pursuit, and the essence of life, death, sacrifice, and atonement. Edward and Alphonse Elric are intricate characters whose personal growth is pivotal to the storyline. Their challenges, aspirations, and philosophical evolution lend complexity to their roles and propel the plot. Brotherhood, produced by Studio Bones, boasts superior animation quality, with detailed character designs and dynamic action scenes. The depiction of alchemical combat is notably well-executed, illustrating inventive and visually stunning uses of alchemy. Brotherhood also presents many emotionally impactful scenes that will hit you deeply, addressing themes of loss, sacrifice, and hope with nuance and depth. For many anime enthusiasts, this series has risen to the top rank, but in my view, there can only be one that holds that title.\\n1.\\nAttack on Titan\\n\\n  ©Hajime Isayama, KODANSHA/“ATTACK ON TITAN” The Final Season Production Committee.\\nAttack on Titan unfolds in a dystopian world where humanity shelters within enormous walled cities to safeguard themselves from Titans, colossal humanoid beings that consume humans apparently without reason. The story centers on Eren Yeager, his adoptive sister Mikasa Ackerman, and their friend Armin Arlert. Following a catastrophic Titan assault that obliterates their home and leads to the death of Eren\\'s mother, Eren pledges to annihilate all Titans. The friends enlist in the military, joining the elite Survey Corps, to combat the Titans and unravel the mysteries behind their existence. They encounter intense battles, political machinations, and ethical quandaries as they face various threats and discover secrets about their world. The series presents a novel and gripping concept: humanity\\'s final stand against monstrous Titans within a secluded society. The narrative\\'s high stakes kept me riveted. The show addresses profound themes like freedom versus security, the essence of evil, the repercussions of war, and the cycle of hatred, prompting viewers to critically examine these issues and empathize with characters they might otherwise despise. Characters such as Eren, Mikasa, and Armin experience considerable growth, adapting and maturing in response to the brutal realities they encounter. Their arcs are emotionally impactful and relatable. With production by WIT Studio and later MAPPA, the series features top-tier animation, intricate character designs, and stunning action sequences, especially the use of 3D maneuver gear in combat. This series has delivered both incredible emotional peaks and crushing lows. For all these reasons, Attack on Titan stands as my all-time favorite anime.\\nWhat did you think of my list?
